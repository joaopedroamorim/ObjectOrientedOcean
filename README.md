# ObjectOrientedOcean

This repository contains general codes using Objected Oriented Progamming for easily visualize general oceanic dataset, as the <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/"> ETOPO bathymetry  </a> or the
<a href ="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-atlas" > World Ocean Atlas 2018 </a>. The intention here was to generate a set of objects, such as 2D Maps, pontual values, line transects on 2D sections, that turns the data visualization faster.
